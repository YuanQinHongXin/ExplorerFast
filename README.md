# ExplorerFast

ExplorerFast is a program written using AutoHotkey (AHK) to speed up folder loading in Windows 11 Explorer. 

## Introduction

There is a "benign bug" in Windows 11, when you press the F11 key twice in Explorer to enter full screen mode and then exit, folders will open and load much faster.
This program has been implemented to activate this speedup effect automatically. Whenever you open a new Explorer window, the program automatically sends the F11 key twice to go into full screen mode and back again. This way you can enjoy extremely fast folder loading.

**Note: The program may pin the Explorer's address bar, it will no longer change according to the path of the folder you are browsing. ** 

## Usage

Download and run ExplorerFast.exe
Or you can compile and modify it yourself using the ahk source code.

## Open source

The project code is open source and follows the MIT license.
